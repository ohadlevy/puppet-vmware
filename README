This module includes all services, packages and configuration information to install a VMWare server "freeware" version. 

Tested on RH/CentOS 5.x, After installation, you should be able to access the server at https://servername:8333

By default, VMWare server will create bridged interface, this means that the virtual clients would be on the same network as your physical server.

If you require a special network setup (e.g. bonded, multiple nics / vlans etc) you should login as root and execute the vmware-config.pl script to modify your network setup.

Note: you can also use the VMWare infrastructure client (ESX Version) with this version of VMWare server.


Authentication

LDAP authentication is supported, and by default root and members of the group vmware-users are allowed to manage the server, you may change it in the permission tab (or edit the authorization file)

License

You would need to put your own license file (as given from VMWare) in the files/etc/vmware directory.
If you don't know how to create one, have a look on another vmware server or run the vmware-config.pl manually.

You can use an old license file (from VMWare server 1.x) as well.

 Local Data storage

It is recommended to keep the virtual machines on a NFS share, you might want to add a mount of the 
/var/lib/vmware directory to some NFS share.
